    // 1.) "0" will get printed due the command at line 6.
    // 2.) Then as c!=n the recursive call will be done and the same method will be run but with the parameters a=1(previously b =1),b=1(previously c=1),c=2(previous "c"+ previous "b")
    // 3.) Then again "1" will get printed due to the print command.
    // 4.) Again c!=n second recursive call will take place with parameters a=1,b=2,c=3.
